## Requirements ##
The game must include 3 difficulty levels.
**Easy** - 8x8 grid with 10 mines
**Medium** - 16x16 grid with 40 mines
**Hard** - 24x24 grid with 99 mines

**Basic Features:**
- Player can recela cells or flag/unflag suspected mines
- When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, adjacent vcells are automatically revealed (flood fill)
- display the game board clearly, showing revelaed numbers, flagged cells, and unrevealed cells
- Track the tie taken by the payer from the first move to clearing the board or hitting a mine
- Score system: the player starts with 100 points, and each second elapsed reduces the score by 1 point; incorrectly flagged   mines reduce the score by 5 points each; completing the board without detonating mines preserves remaining points as the     final score
- Highscores saved between sessions for each difficulty level,recording player's name and score
